BayesOmics
===========

Overview
-----------

**BayesOmics** is a C++ software package for statistical genetics, developed to support integrative analysis of omics data with a focus on genetic architecture, complex trait heritability, and causal inference.
In parallel, **SBayesOmics** is an R package designed to provide complementary functionality for users working in R environments, enabling seamless application of Bayesian modeling techniques to omics data.

Built with a modular and flexible design, BayesOmics implements a suite of Bayesian inference models to estimate genetic effect sizes, prioritize genes, and assess mediated heritability.

Key features:

- Efficient implementation of Bayesian linear models for high-dimensional datasets
- Support for the integrative analysis of GWAS summary statistics with molecular QTLs (e.g., eQTLs, sQTLs, and pQTLs)
- Flexible input formats and seamless handling of large-scale genetic and omics datasets
- An extensible architecture that enables future model development and customization
